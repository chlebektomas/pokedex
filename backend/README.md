# GraphQL Pokemon Server

A simple [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/learn) server that serves Pokemon data. The server is non-persistent and therefore on server restart, data will reset.

# Run server:

```
$ cd backend
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

GraphQL Playground running on https://localhost:4000/graphql.
